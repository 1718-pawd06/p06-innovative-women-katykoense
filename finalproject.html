        <h1>Biography</h1>
        
        <p>Katherine Johnson was born in West Virginia in 1918. Her brilliance in math allowed her to graduate from 
		college in 1937 with the highest honors. After graduating, she worked as a teacher at a public school. 
		Katherine was selected to teach at West Virginia University as one of the first three African Americans to be 
		integrated into the school. There she took a graduate math program, but left after the first semester to start
		a family with her husband. In 1952, Katherine and her family moved to Newport News to pursue a carrer at the National
		Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), later renamed NASA. Katherine spent the next four years analyzing the data 
		of flight tests.</p>

		<p>After the launch of Sputnik in 1957, Katherine was added to the group that was considered the core of the <a 
		href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Task_Group" target="_blank">Space Task Group</a>. She did trajectory 
		analysis and worked on John Glenn's orbital mission. Glenn specifically called on Katherine to run the equations, 
		that had been done in a computer, by hand to check all the numbers. Katherine claims her greatest accomplishment 
		as running the calculations that helped sync the Lunar Lander to the Command and Service Module.</p>
	
	<br />
	
		<p>In 2015, Katherine was awarded the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Medal_of_Freedom" target="_blank">
		Presidential Medal of Freedom</a>. In 2016, she had a movie, <a href="http://www.hiddenfigures.com/" target="_blank">
		<i>Hidden Figures</i></a>, made about her life based off the novel by Margot Lee Shetterly. She now has three kids and 
		eleven grandchildren and encourages them to pursue careers in the fields of math and science. </p>
